# Guess-My-Number-Project

This was a project I was assigned in an udemy course I am currently working through. 
I did the majority without following the video and only turned to the tutorial for help when I got stuck. 
I got stuck updating the highscore as it was constantly updating even when the users score was lower than the current highscore. 
To fix this I re-jgged my if else statements, as shown in the tutorial, and it worked.

The HTML layout and CSS styles were pre made in the tutorial, as I'm currently focusing on JavaScript at the minute so decided to just use the already made page/styles.
